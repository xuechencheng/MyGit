Late Binding
Late Binding is the name of a process in which you load or swap in the desired Sprite Atlas at run time via the Sprite Atlas API. This is necessary when the build does not automatically load a prepared Sprite Atlas at run time (for example, when no Sprite Atlases are included in the build.

Sprites enumeration at run time
To retrieve the contents of a Sprite Atlas at run time, follow these steps:

Create a custom component that takes SpriteAtlasas a public variable.
Assign a Sprite Atlas to the field.
Enter the Editorâ€™s Play Mode.
Access the variable and call the property .GetSprites to retrieve the array of Sprites packed in the selected Atlas.
