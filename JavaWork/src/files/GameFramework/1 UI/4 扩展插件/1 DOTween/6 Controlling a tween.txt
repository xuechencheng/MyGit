Controlling a tween
You have 3 ways to manipulate a tween. All of them share the same method names, except for shortcut-enhanced ones which have an additional DO prefix.

A. Via static methods and filters
The DOTween class contains many static methods that allow you to control tweens.
Each of them comes both in an "All" version (like DOTween.KillAll), which applies to all existing tweens, and a simple version (DOTween.Kill(myTargetOrId)) with a parameter that allows you to filter operations by a tween's id or target (id is set manually via SetId, while target is set automatically when creating a tween via a shortcut).
Static methods additionally return an int, which represents all the tweens that were actually able to perform the requested operation.
	﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿DOTween.PauseAll();
	﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿DOTween.Pause("badoom");
	﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿DOTween.Pause(someTransform);
B. Directly from the tween
instead of using static methods you can just call the same methods from your tween's reference.
	myTween.Pause();
C. From a shortcut-enhanced reference
Same as above, but you can call those same methods from a shortcut-enhanced object. Remember that in this case the method names have an additional DO prefix to distinguish them from the regular object methods.
	transform.DOPause();

Control methods
Again, remember that all these method names are shared by all manipulation ways, but that in case of object shortcuts there's an additional DO prefix.
IMPORTANT: remember that to use these methods on a tween after it has ended, you have to disable its autoKill behaviour, otherwise a tween is automatically killed at completion.
	CompleteAll/Complete(bool withCallbacks = false)
	FlipAll/Flip()
	GotoAll/Goto(float to, bool andPlay = false)
	KillAll/Kill(bool complete = true, params object[] idsOrTargetsToExclude)
	PauseAll/Pause()
	PlayAll/Play()
	PlayBackwardsAll/PlayBackwards()
	PlayForwardAll/PlayForward()
	RestartAll/Restart(bool includeDelay = true, float changeDelayTo = -1)
	RewindAll/Rewind(bool includeDelay = true)
	SmoothRewindAll/SmoothRewind()
	TogglePauseAll/TogglePause()


Special control methods
Common for all tweens
	ForceInit()
Type-specific
These are special control methods that work only on some specific type of tweens
	GotoWaypoint(int waypointIndex, bool andPlay = false)
