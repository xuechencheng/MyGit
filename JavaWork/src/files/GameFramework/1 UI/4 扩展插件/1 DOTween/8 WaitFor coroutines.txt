WaitFor coroutines
Tweens come with a useful set of YieldInstructions which you can place inside your Coroutines, and that allow you to wait for something to happen.
If you're on Unity 5.3 or later, all these methods will have an optional bool parameter that allows to return a CustomYieldInstruction.
	WaitForCompletion()
	WaitForElapsedLoops(int elapsedLoops)
	WaitForKill()
	WaitForPosition(float position)
	WaitForRewind()
	WaitForStart()
