Finding a Memory Leak
To find a memory leak:
1. Launch the player, set it as your Memory Profiler target, and take a snapshot of an empty Scene.
2. Load the Scene you wish to test. Play through some of the Scene to load the necessary assets.
3. Unload the Scene by either calling Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets() or by loading/creating an empty Scene twice.
4. Take another snapshot, and exit Play Mode.
5. In the Workbench, load the first screenshot, then the second, and click Diff. Unity will calculate the difference between the two screenshots. This could take a few seconds,depending on the size of the snapshot.
6. In the Table view, click the header for the Diff column and select Group.
7. Entries will be grouped: same in both snapshots, deleted from the first snapshot, and new.New entries are potential memory leaks.
