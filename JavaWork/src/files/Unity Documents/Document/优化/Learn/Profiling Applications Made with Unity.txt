Since Unity 2017.3, Deep Profile mode works not only in the Editor but also on Android and Desktop using the Mono scripting backend.
Since Unity 2019.3, Allocation Call Stacks reporting is available for all Players and Deep Profiling support can be enabled at build time for all Platforms, including IL2CPP 
To enable Deep Profile mode on Android, use the adb command line argument. For example:
~$ adb shell am start -n com.company.game/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity -e 'unity' '-deepprofiling'
Profiling memory in the Editor is useful for understanding the general trends behind memory behavior, but not for comparing actual values on a specific target device.
For more detailed rendering statistics, open the rendering tab of the Profiler.
