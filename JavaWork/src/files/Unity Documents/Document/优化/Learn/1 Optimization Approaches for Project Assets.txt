All 2D(Sprite and UI)graphic elements should be packed into Sprite Atlases
All textures that are not packed in a Sprite Atlas should have dimensions that are powers of 2 in order to take advantage of memory handling optimizations on the GPU. They donâ€™t necessarily need to be square, but being square and a power of 2 further aids optimization
Longer audio such as background music should have its Load Type in Import Settings set to Streaming rather than Decompress on Load or Compressed in Memory
One common solution is the adoption of object pooling.
